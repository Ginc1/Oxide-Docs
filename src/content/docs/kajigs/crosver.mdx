title: ChromeOS Versioning
---

Depending on your ChromeOS version, you may or may not be able to use some kajigs.

# Determining your ChromeOS version
## Method 1
Go to chrome://version

It should have a number like v1xx on version for one of the lines, thats your version. Ignore anything after the decimal, it probably doesnt matter for you.


## Method 2
Go to settings, scroll down to the "about chromeos" or update page, and it should say the version.


## Method 3
Go to the lockscreen (ctrl+shift+q+q, sign out, restart the chromebook)
press ALT+V

It should show the version in the top right, "Google Chrome X"


# What does this mean for me?
If your chromeos ver is below the version required for the kajig you want to do, then you can do the kajig without issue.

If it is NOT, you need to go through [Kernel Version Info](/kajigs/kernverinfo) to see if it is possible to downgrade to the version needed.
