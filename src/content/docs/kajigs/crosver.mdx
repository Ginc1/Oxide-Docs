Depending on your ChromeOS version, you may or may not be able to use some kajigs.

# Determining your ChromeOS version

## Method 1

Go to `chrome://version`

It should have a number like `v1xx` on version for one of the lines, that's your version. Ignore anything after the decimal, it probably doesn't matter for you.

## Method 2

Go to "settings", scroll down to the "about ChromeOS" or update page, and it should say the version.

## Method 3

Go to the lockscreen (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Q</kbd> + <kbd>Q</kbd>, sign out, restart the Chromebook)
Press <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd>

It should show the version in the top right, "Google Chrome X"

# What does this mean for me?

If your ChromeOS version is below the version required for the kajig you want to do, then you can do the kajig without issue.

If it is NOT, you need to go through [Kernel Version Info](/kajigs/kernver-info) to see if it is possible to downgrade to the version needed.
