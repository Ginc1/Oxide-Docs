## What is a kernver and what does it mean for me?

Kernel versions, often referred to as kernvers, are what Chromebooks use to lock down how low of a version you can update to.

If you are on these kernvers, these are the minimum ChromeOS versions you can use.

| Kernver | Minimum ChromeOS Version |
| ------- | ------------------------ |
| `0`     | any                      |
| `1`     | any                      |
| `2`     | v111                     |
| `3`     | v120                     |
| `4`     | v125                     |
| `5`     | v132.0.6834.201          |
| `6`     | v138.0.7204.221          |

## Determining your kernver

1. Hold <kbd>Esc</kbd> + <kbd>Power</kbd> + <kbd>Refresh</kbd> for a bit less than a second
2. Once the recovery screen appears, press <kbd>Tab</kbd>
3. It should show a line that starts with "TPM:" and ends with "0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", or "6". If it's a higher number, this doc is probably not up to date. The number it ends with is your kernver.
