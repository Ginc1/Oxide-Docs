title: Omada DNS
---

[Omada](https://omada.cafe)  is a community and small group of people working on hosting free and open source services on the basis of freedom, privacy and decentralization. 
One of these services are Omada DNS, which breaks lightspeed, securly, goguardian and more from working simply using a network setting. This also breaks chromeOS updates.

If your school has "Managed networks" on, use [caudns](/kajigs/caudns)

## Guide
1. Go to settings -> Wi-Fi -> Known Networks
2. Select a network
3. Dropdown the "Network" option
4. Click "Name servers -> Custom name servers
5. Set the first field to `66.23.198.252`, the second field to `66.94.105.229`, the third field to `0.0.0.0`, and the fourth to `0.0.0.0`
6. Repeat steps 3-5 on all other networks
7. Restart your chromebook to clear cached blocked websites.

## Issues
lightspeed keeps a cache for two weeks of blocked websites. Simply use the DNS for more than two weeks

this does NOT work on filters such as contentkeeper, iboss, most cisco configurations, or fortiguard. They are network level.

If you're already using omadadns, continue to do so, and DO NOT connect to a wifi network without it, unless your extensions may update and be patched.

This commonly breaks locked mode quizes, to fix them revert the DNS then reboot your chromebook and go to chrome://policy and press "refresh policies". If that does not work, then disable DNS --> remove user --> add user back
