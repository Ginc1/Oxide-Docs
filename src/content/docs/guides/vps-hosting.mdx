When it comes to hosting a web proxy service, the most important factors in determining a server's purchase are bandwidth and CPU specifications. Although TitaniumNetwork has built most of its proxies to optimize resource usage, web proxies still tend to be heavy on the CPU. If you are hosting a rather large service or planning to host a large service using TitaniumNetwork's SDK, consider prioritizing bandwidth. Being able to handle all of this is essential.

## Simple metrics?

If you are getting around one million users per month, you should at least have a 1 GBPS public port or 800 GBPS private port. Always go for private ports.

Consider a 1-10GBPS port for a dedicated instance if you are getting over a million.
