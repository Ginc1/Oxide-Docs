title: Masqr
description: Masqr is an "anti link leaking" authentication system that allows you to use a domain on specific devices to prevent web filters from detecting a web service.  The project also is a go-to method for site cloaking with other web sources protecting the main domain.

## What is MASQR?

Think of it like an "anti link leaking" system for proxy bots. The link you recieve is unique and will only work once, which can prevent filters from catching on and help proxy site owners by not making them buy new links that will just get blocked.

## How can I deploy this?

This is fairly easy to deploy to your backend using `express`, as seen in the [`MasqrBackend` example](https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/MasqrProject/blob/master/MasqrBackend/index.js), and you can implement this into different backends fairly similarly.
You can also use [`masqr-middleware`](https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/masqr-middleware) if you'd like to avoid implementing it yourself.

To set this up you'll want to create a few files, in addition to adding this to your app.
Those files include

- Checkfailed.html - this will be your fallback failure page
- placeholder.svg, a default image for v0.dev sites

Optionally, place a folder named `Masqrd` in your server directory
Inside `Masqrd`, an individual masqd page for when domain fails for EACH domain
for example, if anura.christmas fails to validate, it will serve `./Masqrd/anura.christmas.html.`

## How it works

MASQR is pretty simple. Links from proxy bots (eg. Titanium Network's bot) will give you a link that looks like this: `https://u:abc123@example.com`. The `u:abc123` part is a one-time use password for HTTP authentication. The server then generates a license that's saved as a cookie, and whenever you visit that site, it checks your cookie with the one in the server. If you visit the site without a valid password or cookie, it sends you the fallback site.
