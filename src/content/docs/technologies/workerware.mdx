A simple express-style middleware layer for service workers.

## What is Workerware?

Workerware allows for the plugins to be loaded from an external source (i.e IndexedDB), and have it parsed and act as functional middleware.

## Usage

workerware is simplistic by design. You just need to import the main library with `importScripts`

```js
importScripts("/path/to/workerware.js");
```

Then you can instantiate a new instance of workerware with the `new` keyword.

```js
// Default options, these don't need to be provided on instantiation.
const ww = new WorkerWare({
  debug: false,
  randomNames: false,
  timing: false
});
```

And finally, you can load a middleware by either importing a script, or loading a compliant function string from a separate source, and calling `new Function()` on the string.

```js
ww.use({
  // Required
  function: self.adblockExt.filterRequest,
  // Required, can take in multiple events!
  events: ["fetch"],
  // Optional, defaults to function.prototype.name, or is set to a random string if randomNames is set to true.
  name: "Adblock",
  // Optional configuration that can be accessed by the middleware under event.workerware.config
  configuration: {
    foo: "bar"
  }
});
```

**Notes:**

- The `name` property will be automatically set to either the passed in value, `function.prototype.name`, or a random UUID. All depending on the options and passed in values.
- The `function` property needs to be a function *reference*, for example, `self.adblockExt.filterRequest()` will likely NOT properly work, as this will pass in the return value of the function, not the function itself.

A valid list of Worker events can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerGlobalScope)

Middlewares can also be deleted by event type or name, by doing the following.

```js
// Duplicate names should not exist, but if they do then every middleware by the passed in name will be deleted.
ww.deleteByName("Adblock");
```

or

```js
// WARNING: This will unregister EVERY middleware for this event type.
ww.deleteByEvent("fetch");
```

This library is still being actively maintained, with features being frequently added. If you have an interesting feature idea, feel free to open an issue about it.
